# Why Unix Systems are superior
## (for developers)

--- 

# Agenda

* How do we define a Unix system?
* Pain points outside Unix systems
* Added bonuses of Unix and opensource tools
* Quick intro to the command line


---

# How do we define a Unix system?

Implementing POSIX standards (maybe include a bit about this)
Its way of defining filesystems
Having a command line that works in harmony with the rest of the system


---

# Pain points outside Unix systems

File locks
Command line seems separate from the rest of the system (not like a building block)
Libraries for programming and other things can be tricky to install sometimes!
Package managers are often incomplete or has a very limited selection 
Minimal customizability -> usually rely on external programs. Mac is sadly not much better, but still more opportunities) 

Command line doesn't have pipes! Or they are very primitive!

---

# Added bonuses of Unix and opensource tools

Multi-user system -> no admin/Root access by default
Most logs and diagnostic information can usually be accessed
Better community information on how to fix things (since everything is customizable!)

---

# Quick intro to the command line

Let's learn some commands!

---

# File management and navigation

*ls*                       View the contents of the current directory
*cd new-directory*         Change from the current directory to new-directory
*pwd*                      Print the current directory we are in
*mv x y*                   Move x to y (e.g, sample.md to java/superawesome9000X/README.md)
*cp x y*                   Copy x to y (y can include a new directory and a new name)
*touch myfile*             Creates an empty file called myfile

# Searching

-- todo: find a good way of showing grep examples

--- 

# Reading docs

-- TODO: see if we can find a way of introducing man...

---

# Pipes 101

echo "Writing a test file"

---

# Scripts!

-- todo: basic intro to scripting. Just show that you can automate...

Thank you all! Now go home and learn more about Unix-inspired systems! :)
